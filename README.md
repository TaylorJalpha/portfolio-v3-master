**üõ†Ô∏è This project is still a WIP (Work-in-progress) ‚Äì Mobile optimizations needed for the animated experience timeline and portfolio view, PDF viewing experience on mobile, primarily, and a few additional features need to be improved to be considered finished as part of v3.1 - Testing in production to get these optimizations live ASAP**

# ‚ö°Ô∏èNuxt Bento Portfolio

This is a modern, quasi-minimal, and highly customizable portfolio template built with Nuxt 3, Vue, and Tailwind CSS‚Äî[Fork of the Ladvace Astro theme]( https://github.com/Ladvace/astro-bento-portfolio) by [Appdev95](https://github.com/apdev95/bento-portfolio-nuxt ). Crafted for developers, technical product managers, engineers, data scientists, or anyone technical who wants to showcase their work in a design-focused way with dense content sections for a hasty overview on page load, it features a bento grid hero section, an experience timeline, and a versatile portfolio view supporting blog posts, case studies with an embedded PDF viewer, projects, and tags. Effortlessly connect your own [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) headless CMS to manage portfolio items, and use any backend you prefer (Rails, Node, etc.) to handle contact form submissions and API logic.

---

## Features

- Bento-grid hero section to display dense content and animations for a quick overview of experience, skills, etc
- The experience timeline was modeled after Acternity.ui [Aurora Background component](https://ui.aceternity.com/components/aurora-background),converted from React to Vue Syntax
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly
- Portfolio view with easy integration with your own Sanity headless CMS, or CMS of your choosing
- Contact form with backend support (Rails example included)
- Rails API proxy is used to fetch Sanity data via the POST HTTP method from the Nuxt front end. It sets CORS, .env variables, and other necessary configurations. Ping me ff you‚Äôd like a copy of the Rails backend, more than happy to duplicate and share
- Built for quick deployment and customization
- The footer or secondary navigation section includes a title and paragraph section with an icon and ping animation. It also includes social links + icons and a list of core skills that can link/route to desired locations within the viewport or site - Contact Me from the Footer currently triggers the contact form modal to open in the Hero section, this will be resolved no later than 09-28-2025
- You can find the Rails backend Readme within the Nuxt repo: portfolio-v3-master/backend-example/README.md <- WIP, needs a few updates.

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
# Clone repo
$ git clone https://github.com/TaylorJalpha/portfolio-v3-master.git

$ npm run dev
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Connect Your Own Sanity Headless CMS

1. [Create a Sanity.io project](https://www.sanity.io/get-started) and set up your schemas for projects, case studies, and blog posts (see `schemas copy/` for examples).
2. In your Nuxt app, set the following environment variables (in a `.env` file or your deployment platform):
	 - `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` (your Sanity project ID)
	 - `SANITY_DATASET` (usually `production`)
	 - `SANITY_API_TOKEN` (optional, for write access)
3. The app will use these to fetch portfolio items dynamically. You can update the logic in `lib/sanity.ts` and `services/sanityApi.js` if you want to customize queries or endpoints.

## Contact Form & Backend API

The contact form is ready to send data to a backend of your choice. By default, it‚Äôs set up for a Rails API, but you can swap in Node, Python, or any backend you like.

### Example: Rails Backend

1. Create a Rails API with a `ContactForm` controller to handle POST requests.
2. Enable CORS and CSRF protection for API requests.
3. Update the `baseURL` in `components/ContactForm.vue` and `services/sanityApi.js` to point to your backend.
4. The backend should accept JSON data and (optionally) forward it to Sanity or send you an email.

**Sample Rails endpoint:**

```ruby
# app/controllers/contact_form_controller.rb
class ContactFormController < ApplicationController
	protect_from_forgery with: :null_session
	def create
		# Save to DB, send email, or forward to Sanity
		render json: { message: "Received!" }, status: :created
	end
end
```

## Next Steps

- **Mobile Optimizations:** Improving the experience for portfolio items, case studies, and posts, with a special focus on better PDF viewing and device-specific enhancements.
- **About Me Page:** Adding a dedicated `/about-me` page to share a more story-driven overview of my professional journey.
- **Gen-AI Feature:** Exploring the addition of a generative AI feature (acceptance criteria still to be determined).
