# ‚ö°Ô∏èNuxt Bento Portfolio

This is a modern, quasi-minimal, and highly customizable portfolio template built with Nuxt 3, Vue, and Tailwind CSS‚Äî[Fork of the Ladvace Astro theme]( https://github.com/Ladvace/astro-bento-portfolio) by [Appdev95](https://github.com/apdev95/bento-portfolio-nuxt ). Crafted for developers, technical product managers, engineers, data scientists, or anyone technical who wants to showcase their work in a design-focused way with dense content sections for a hasty overview on page load, it features a bento grid hero section, an experience timeline, and a versatile portfolio view supporting blog posts, case studies with an embedded PDF viewer, projects, and tags. Effortlessly connect your own [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) headless CMS to manage portfolio items, and use any backend you prefer (Rails, Node, etc.) to handle contact form submissions and API logic.

## Features

Key Features

‚Ä¢ Modern UI: A bento-grid hero section provides a dense, interactive overview of skills and experience, enhanced with animations.
‚Ä¢ Customizable Timeline: The experience timeline is a custom implementation based on the Acternity UI Aurora Background component, re-built specifically for Vue.
‚Ä¢ Fully Responsive: The application is built to be fully responsive and mobile-friendly across all devices.
‚Ä¢ CMS Integration: The portfolio view is designed for easy integration with a Sanity headless CMS, but can be adapted for any CMS of your choice.
‚Ä¢ Backend & API:
‚Ä¢ A functional contact form with included backend support (a Rails API example is provided).
‚Ä¢ The Rails API acts as a proxy to securely fetch data from Sanity via POST requests, handling critical configurations like CORS and environment variables.
‚Ä¢ The backend's README.md is located at portfolio-v3-master/backend-example/README.md and contains detailed setup instructions.
‚Ä¢ Quick Deployment: The project is structured for rapid deployment and straightforward customization.
‚Ä¢ Interactive Footer: The footer features a dynamic, multi-purpose design:
‚Ä¢ A section for a title, paragraph, and an animated icon.
‚Ä¢ Social media links with corresponding icons.
‚Ä¢ A list of core skills that can be configured to navigate to specific sections of the site.

## üõ†Ô∏è Connect Your Own Sanity Headless CMS

1. [Create a Sanity.io project](https://www.sanity.io/get-started) and set up your schemas for projects, case studies, and blog posts (see `schemas copy/` for examples).
2. In your Nuxt app, set the following environment variables (in a `.env` file or your deployment platform):
	 - `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` (your Sanity project ID)
	 - `SANITY_DATASET` (usually `production`)
	 - `SANITY_API_TOKEN` (optional, for write access)
3. The app will use these to fetch portfolio items dynamically. You can update the logic in `lib/sanity.ts` and `services/sanityApi.js` if you want to customize queries or endpoints.

## Contact Form & Backend API

The contact form is ready to send data to a backend of your choice. By default, it‚Äôs set up for a Rails API, but you can swap in Node, Python, or any backend you like.

### Example: Rails Backend

1. Create a Rails API with a `ContactForm` controller to handle POST requests.
2. Enable CORS and CSRF protection for API requests.
3. Update the `baseURL` in `components/ContactForm.vue` and `services/sanityApi.js` to point to your backend.
4. The backend should accept JSON data and (optionally) forward it to Sanity or send you an email.

**Sample Rails endpoint:**

```ruby
# app/controllers/contact_form_controller.rb
class ContactFormController < ApplicationController
	protect_from_forgery with: :null_session
	def create
		# Save to DB, send email, or forward to Sanity
		render json: { message: "Received!" }, status: :created
	end
end
```
